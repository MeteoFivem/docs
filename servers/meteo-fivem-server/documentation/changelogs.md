**Watch out for scammers.** The only legitimate place to purchase the meteo fivem server is <a href="https://meteofivem.net/meteo-fivem-server" target="_blank">meteofivem.net/meteo-fivem-server</a>. Scammers often copy our changelogs to make their fake versions look real. If you bought it anywhere else (random Discord servers, third-party resellers, "leaked" downloads), you did not get the real product - and you will not get updates, support, or security patches from us.
